(JqueryUi draggable for non-HTML5 compliant browsers to use awesome Drag-N-Drop aggregate feature. However, you can still groupby without draggability)\n\n***\n\n## About\n__ng-grid__ Originally built on knockout we wanted to port it to angular.\n\nversion 2.0.5\n\n[nuGet](https://nuget.org/packages/ng-grid)\n\n\nQuestions, Comments, Complaints? feel free to email us at nggridteam@gmail.com\n\n***\n\n## Roadmap\n\nWe are going to be adding more features here as we head to a 3.0 release, including:\n\n* Anything else the rest of the community wants to contribute that isn't a terrible idea. :)\n\n***\n_The bare bones_:\n\n```html\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"angular.js\"></script>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"ng-grid.js\"></script>\n<script>\n    angular.module('myApp',['ngGrid', ... {other includes}]);\n</script>\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"../ng-grid.css\" /> \n<body ng-app=\"myApp\">\n    <div ng-grid=\"myOptions\"></div>\n<body>\n```\n```javascript\n// Define your own controller somewhere..\nfunction MyCtrl($scope) {\n\t$scope.myData = [{name: \"Moroni\", age: 50},\n                     {name: \"Teancum\", age: 43},\n                     {name: \"Jacob\", age: 27},\n                     {name: \"Nephi\", age: 29},\n                     {name: \"Enos\", age: 34}];\n\t$scope.myOptions = { data: 'myData' };\n\t// you can also specify data as: $scope.myOptions = { data: $scope.myData }. \n\t// However, updates to the underlying data will not be reflected in the grid\n};\n\n```\n\n## Want More?\nCheck out the [Getting Started](https://github.com/angular-ui/ng-grid/wiki/Getting-started) and other [Docs](https://github.com/angular-ui/ng-grid/wiki)\n\n## Examples\n[Examples](http://angular-ui.github.com/ng-grid/)\n\n## Testing\n\nThe testing setup is based on the [angular-seed project](https://github.com/angular/angular-seed/).\n\nMake sure to set your CHROME_BIN environment variable to the full path to chrome.exe (not just its directory).\n\n### Grunt tasks\n\nThere are a few grunt tasks for running tests:\n    \n    # Run unit tests\n    > grunt karma:unit\n    # Or use this alias:\n    > grunt test\n\n    # Run end-to-end tests (make sure to first start a web server as specified below)\n    > grunt karma:e2e\n\n    # Run midway tests\n    > grunt karma:midway\n\n### End-to-end tests\n\nThe e2e tests need a webserver to run. A simple one from the angular-seed project is included:\n\n    > ./scripts/web-server.js\n\n### Automated testing and building\n\nRunning this task will automatically rebuild `build/ng-grid.debug.js` when source files change, and run unit tests when `build/ng-grid.debug.js` or unit test files change. Youc an use this for testing during development.\n\n    # Run this in its own window\n    > grunt testwatch\n\n### Integration testing\n\nThere is a task for CI testing with PhantomJS\n\n1. Make sure the PHANTOMJS_BIN environment variable  is set properly\n2. PhantomJS with the singleRun option doesn't appear to function properly in Windows. The tests will run but PhantomJS will not automatically close.\n\n    > grunt karma:ci\n\n\n## Change Log\n* __2013-04-23__ - Version 2.0.5 - Moving to $http for external template fetching. Should fix issues with grid rendering before templates are retrieved, as well as fetching the same template multiple times. Also fixed bug that prevented the grid from maintaining row selections post-sort thanks to [sum4me](https://github.com/sum4me).\n* __2013-04-08__ - Version 2.0.4 - fixing some more minor bugs.\n* __2013-03-29__ - Version 2.0.3 - changed default multiSelect behavior, updating some plugins and making some more minor bugfixes.\n* __2013-03-08__ - Version 2.0.2 - minor bugfixes, updating some plugins.\n* __2013-03-05__ - Version 2.0.1 - Moved to grunt build system. No more international version; all languages are included by default. Fixed minor grouping display issue. Using $templateCache for templates instead of global namespace.\n* __2013-03-05__ - Version 2.0.0 - Breaking Changes: see documentation (showSelectionBox, enableRowSelection, showFooter). Column Virtualization added. Row virtualization performance improved. Excel-like editing instead of enableFocusedCellEdit.\n* __2013-02-18__ - Version 1.9.0 - Aggregates now display correctly. Added more option methods to select and group data (see wiki), Added column pinning.\n* __2013-02-11__ - Version 1.8.0.hotfix - Fixes for multi-level grouping and adding the gridId to both the grid options and as argument to the \"ngGridEventData\" so you can identify what grid it came from.\n* __2013-02-07__ - Version 1.8.0 - Major architectural changes which greatly improves performance. virtualizationThreshold now controlls when virtualization is force-enabled and is user-specified in options.\n* __2013-02-06__ - Version 1.7.1 - Fixed bug with selections and multiple grids. New emit message for notifying when hitting bottom of viewport. Can disable virtualization. ng-grid virtualization is on by default, but can be disabled if there are less than 50 rows in the grid. Anything > 50 rows virtualization is forced on for performance considerations.\n* __2013-02-05__ - Version 1.7.0 - BREAKING CHANGES: Will add examples.

Fixed #93.\n* __2013-01-09__ - Version 1.6.2 - Merged changes to have two-way data-binding work in templates, so if you're using a celltemplate, you can now use COL_FIELD instead of row.getProperty(col.field). row.getProperty is still in the row class for accessing other row values.\n* __2013-01-08__ - Version 1.6.1 - Adding ability to preselect rows. Can deselect when multiSelect:false. Bug fixes/merging pull requests. Bower now works. Can now sync external search with ng-grid internal search.
